## Project 2: The Parser

Name:		Duong Tuan Hoang
Section: 	CMPSCI 4280 - Program Translation Project
VCS:		git
Date:		03/23/2022
Project Option:	Option 3 with FSA table + driver (100 points) 

## Files	
	main.c - the main program to process the input
	parser.c, parser.h - the parser of the program
	node.h - header file defining the nodes of the tree
	tree.c, tree.h - file containing functions to build and destroy the parse tree
	token.h - header file defining tokenID and token data type
	lex.h - header file defining basic lexical definition
	helper.h - header file containing FSA table and references to operators, keywords, token names and errors
	scanner.h, scanner.c - the scanner program
	Makefile 	

## Run the program
	> make
	> To give the program keyboard input, run: ./frontEnd (remember to Enter and then Ctrl + D 
	to finish the input)
	> To direct the input from a file into program, run: ./frontEnd < filename
	> To let the program read input from a file, run: ./frontEnd filename

## Remove all executable and object files

	> make clean

## Description
	> Based on the lexical definition provided, the scanner will parse through the file and 
	export 4 types of token "identifier", "number", "operator", and "EOF".
	> The scanner will automatically skip whitespace and comments surrounded by "##".
	> The parser will call scanner every time it needs a token 
	> The parser will parse the program based on the BNF grammar provided. There are some modifications 
	made to ensure the programm is in LL(1).
	Modification: 
		<stat> -> .... | <general loop>;|... <instead of loop1 and loop2>
		<general loop> -> repeat (<loop1> | <loop2>)
		The fragment '[<expr><RO><expr>]' is turned into <condition> for short
		<N> -> <A><N'>
		<N'>-> +<A><N'> | /<A><N'> | empty
 
	> This scanner can determine 5 errors which is specified in the lex.h. If the program encounter
	error, the error is reported to the screen and then the program is terminated. 
	> The parser will give the specific error if it found out that the current token doesn't not match
	with the expected token
